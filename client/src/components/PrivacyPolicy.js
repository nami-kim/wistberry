            Wistberry’s credit card transactions are fulfilled by an authorized
            banking institution. When collecting credit card information for
            online purchases, Wistberry offers secured server transactions that
            encrypt your information in transit to help prevent others from
            accessing it. Personal information is stored on servers that are
            protected by appropriate safeguards, and will be accessible by
            authorized employees and agents who require access in connection
            with their responsibilities. Your credit card details are encrypted
            and then removed from our system once your order has been
            dispatched.

          <h3>ANONYMITY</h3>
          <p>
            Wistberry will generally provide individuals with the option of not
            identifying themselves when entering into transactions when it is
            lawful and practicable to do so. However, on many occasions, we will
            not be able to do this. For example, we will need your address in
            order to deliver any products purchased through our website.
